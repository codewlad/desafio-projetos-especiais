                <h1>BARRY BURTON</h1>
                <p>A fan of weapons, he makes them his hobby and his specialty within S.T.A.R.S., where he is part of the Alpha Team. Barry was part of SWAT for years, and his experience made him perfect to join the elite squad of the Raccoon Police Department. Besides guns, his other great love is his family, and to protect his wife and two daughters, Moira and Poly, he will do anything in the world.</p>
