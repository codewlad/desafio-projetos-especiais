                <h1>THE GAME</h1>
                <p>Bizarre crimes begin to plague little Raccoon City and an elite team, the S.T.A.R.S. are sent to handle the case. After 24 hours without radio contact, the Alpha team is also dispatched and while searching for signs of what has happened, they are attacked by wild dogs and the pilot escapes taking the helicopter. The surviving officers find themselves with no option but to take refuge in a mansion that is spotted in the distance.</p>
                <p>This is where the game begins. You take on the role of Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, and must investigate the mysterious house, while searching for your companions and trying to survive the horde of creatures that infests the place, from humans turned into zombies to stronger and more lethal creatures.</p>
